### Current Behavior

### Stack trace
<!--
    If the compositor crashes, please make sure you built it with debug info, and provide a stack trace captured when it crashed.
    Note, when the compositor crashes in a debugger, your screen might look frozen. But gdb will likely still handle your input if it is focused.
    Often you can use 'bt' and press enter to get the stack trace, then 'q', enter, 'y', enter to quit gdb.

<!-- Or, you can enable core dump, and upload the core file with the corresponding executable here. -->
