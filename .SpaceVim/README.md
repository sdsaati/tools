SpaceVim is a modular configuration of Vim and Neovim.
It's inspired by spacemacs. It manages collections of plugins in layers,
which help to collect related packages together to provide features.
This approach helps keep the configuration organized and reduces
overhead for the user by keeping them from having to think about
what packages to install.
